Everyone has those questions that they plunge into when their well of contemplation dries up. Mine might’ve lurked around long before then, maybe too unsure of a question for my childhood brain to fully form, but the earliest memory I have of grasping those fragments was around eight or nine — maybe ten? — years old. It emerges every so often, but it’s still a concept that, to this day, I’m not sure what I was — and am — trying to get at.

It was past evening and the moon gleaming outside appeared to suck the sky of its darkness. I was laying in bed next to the window, seemingly right under the rosy glare of the moon. My memory of that night is muddled and the details low resolution, but I remember that I couldn’t see stars in the New York City night sky then — and I still can’t now.

It was quick — the transition. The room behind my eyes compressed everything until I had an omniscient narrator’s view of the galaxy. Earth was in the distance, perhaps to provide familiarity in an unfamiliar setting (after all, who had actually been to space?). What was added in perspective was taken away in years: I imagined myself — or was it me? — as a little fetus baby, somehow floating in space. There was another identical fetus right next to the first, also floating. The fetus was a clone, but not exactly. I think the best way to describe it would be in terms of arrays and objects: It was a deep copy, rather than a shallow one.

And I wondered if someone else — that deep copy fetus, for example — could be me (what I mean by that is they had my consciousness — or rather, they had the consciousness I would have had if I was me instead). If they were indeed me, would they have the same personality (by personality I mean the essence of someone, before they came into the world, and all of the environmental factors and nurturing came into play)? And if not, would I still be me if I had been born a second later, if the doctor had started the birth procedure a second later, if my mother had gotten pregnant a second later. Replace all the later’s with earlier’s and there goes another set of questions that ran through my head. And would all that have affected how the environmental factors affected me or, in other words, would changing the conditions of my birth — down to the second — affect how I reacted to the environmental factors after I came into the world? Would that have changed who I was? And if I wasn’t still me if a condition changed — aka someone else was me — would that person have a different personality then? But more importantly, if, say, someone else was me, could they have been me even if things stayed the same — if I was me because of pure chance — or because the conditions changed?

This is one of the most difficult thoughts I’ve tried to understand and put into words, but I don’t know if I fully captured the extent of my questions. I think I feel asleep then, or perhaps shoved these thoughts away in a corner so that I could fall asleep. And I think that’s what I’ll do again — at least, until the next time these questions pops into my head.
