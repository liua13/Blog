No matter how many times I flick it away, shake my head, or tell myself to stop worrying, the thought still lingers. And when I was done building this website -- my blog -- I had the same gnawing impression. What would my first blog post be about?</p>\n<p>I have a list of potential topics I could write about, a list I’ve compiled to prevent exact situations like these (but alas, the irony of it all). But as my eyes scanned down the list, nothing seemed right. Nothing seemed right -- much less perfect -- for the first blog post.</p>\n<p>I don’t know what changed, but a seed planted in my mind. I knew that I had to write a blog post; I couldn’t just skip to Blog Post #27039. So why not a blog post about firsts to mark the occasion? At first, I pushed the idea aside, but the more I thought about it, the more right it felt. My gut was agreeing with me.</p>\n<p>One of the first things that comes to mind when I think about firsts is my physics class during my junior year of high school. We were learning about static and kinetic friction, and my teacher at the time was explaining to us that static friction was larger than kinetic friction because it takes much more energy to move a static object. Similarly, it takes more energy to start something new than something you’ve grown accustomed to. Whether it’s a new project or a new habit, you need that initial momentum to get you rolling up that hill, even as the friction of your own fear tries to push you down. Whenever I start something, there’s a feeling of excitement mixed with nervousness and fear from not knowing what to expect -- and it’s that excitement that serves as the momentum I need to start.</p>\n<p>This is my first blog post of (hopefully) many. I hope you take something from this, whether it’s to learn more about me, pick up an interesting word or phrase, or learn something new. And I hope I take something from this -- improve my writing, connect with people and words, and learn something new as well.</p>\n<p>You may ask why I posted this so soon before the new decade -- why not just wait until January 1, 2020 before posting one? Part of it is that I’m impatient, but a much larger reason is to remind myself that I should be thinking about improvement on a continuous spectrum, not one that resets after the year’s over. I shouldn’t wait until January 1 to start my New Year’s resolution; I should take action now to change and grow into the person I want to become. Posting this on December 30, 2019 will remind me -- every time I scroll down and read my later posts -- that I will bring into 2020 what I learned in 2019.</p>","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/havah/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"March 7, 2020","title":"Havah","subtitle":"From being vegetarian to writing a novel together, Havah has taught me a lot about myself and the world around me.","image":"havah.jpg","caption":"Havah spent a weekend with me in Boston during my first semester of MIT.","categories":["writing"]},"html":"<p>It would be a lie to say that Havah and I immediately clicked. We met through a mutual friend at the end of sixth grade, but by that time I’d already formed a hasty opinion of her. I observed, judged, and decided from afar that I wasn’t interested in forming a relationship. She was too chirpy to the point of being obnoxious, and at an age where irrationalities ran high, I succumbed to my first impressions without further thought.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until seventh grade that I realized just how wrong I was. I’m not entirely sure the exact day we considered each other best friends, but the pages of my journal reflected a transition from frustration to excitement as my relationship with Havah blossomed. From using creative insults to memorize vocabulary words and discussing the prospects of life after death on our walks after school, I realized that her chirpiness was an optimistic outlook on life that I embrace today and her obnoxiousness was simply unfounded. Her encouragements helped me realize my love for journaling, while my support helped her discover her passion for biology and we watched her 76% in sixth grade science boost to 95% in seventh grade. From the laughs we shared in Chipotle and the hours we spent perfecting our peanut throws at Five Guys to being vegetarian and going to our first debate tournament together, Havah was right alongside me as we figured life out.</p>\n<p>Our interests in creative writing and similar approaches to life provided a strong basis for a collaboration on a novel in eighth grade, but not all conflicts were easily resolved. We set tight deadlines and high expectations, and argued over trivial aspects of the plot or what the cover should look like. But our bond strengthened as we learned to effectively communicate with each other, and in three months, finished the novel in 80,000 words and 26 chapters. Although “Tangled in Love” was filled with misplaced periods and run-on sentences, I’m proud we reached our goal and learned so much in the process. But all things come to an end, and middle school was no exception. We’d already discussed our matriculation to different high schools, but the tears fell nonetheless. Our yearbook messages were short and sweet, encompassing years of friendship in two inside jokes that will forever bring a smile to our faces.</p>\n<p>My relationship with Havah has changed since middle school, but the unconditional support we had for each other still remains. She was there for me when I twisted my knee in ninth grade and I was there for her as she learned about her identity. We spend Friday nights catching up on our lives, sometimes going back to Chipotle where it all started or calling each other when our schedules conflict. We spend breaks exploring the next chapter of our lives, planning our next novel or trekking across the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge to explore nature’s finest. And when we’re lost in the serenity of the trees around us, I’m reminded of the importance of looking beyond the superficial and appreciating all the cultures around me—because without an open mind, I would have missed out on one of best friendships of my life. Havah may not always be right by my side, but the lessons she has placed in my heart are more than enough. And perhaps, one day, I’ll leave a mark on the world as long-lasting as the influence Havah has left on my life.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
