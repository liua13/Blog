No matter how many times I flick it away, shake my head, or tell myself to stop worrying, the thought still lingers. And when I was done building this website -- my blog -- I had the same gnawing impression. What would my first blog post be about?</p>\n<p>I have a list of potential topics I could write about, a list I’ve compiled to prevent exact situations like these (but alas, the irony of it all). But as my eyes scanned down the list, nothing seemed right. Nothing seemed right -- much less perfect -- for the first blog post.</p>\n<p>I don’t know what changed, but a seed planted in my mind. I knew that I had to write a blog post; I couldn’t just skip to Blog Post #27039. So why not a blog post about firsts to mark the occasion? At first, I pushed the idea aside, but the more I thought about it, the more right it felt. My gut was agreeing with me.</p>\n<p>One of the first things that comes to mind when I think about firsts is my physics class during my junior year of high school. We were learning about static and kinetic friction, and my teacher at the time was explaining to us that static friction was larger than kinetic friction because it takes much more energy to move a static object. Similarly, it takes more energy to start something new than something you’ve grown accustomed to. Whether it’s a new project or a new habit, you need that initial momentum to get you rolling up that hill, even as the friction of your own fear tries to push you down. Whenever I start something, there’s a feeling of excitement mixed with nervousness and fear from not knowing what to expect -- and it’s that excitement that serves as the momentum I need to start.</p>\n<p>This is my first blog post of (hopefully) many. I hope you take something from this, whether it’s to learn more about me, pick up an interesting word or phrase, or learn something new. And I hope I take something from this -- improve my writing, connect with people and words, and learn something new as well.</p>\n<p>You may ask why I posted this so soon before the new decade -- why not just wait until January 1, 2020 before posting one? Part of it is that I’m impatient, but a much larger reason is to remind myself that I should be thinking about improvement on a continuous spectrum, not one that resets after the year’s over. I shouldn’t wait until January 1 to start my New Year’s resolution; I should take action now to change and grow into the person I want to become. Posting this on December 30, 2019 will remind me -- every time I scroll down and read my later posts -- that I will bring into 2020 what I learned in 2019.</p>","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/havah/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"March 7, 2020","title":"Havah","subtitle":"From being vegetarian to writing a novel together, Havah has taught me a lot about myself and the world around me.","image":"havah.jpg","caption":"Havah spent a weekend with me in Boston during my first semester of MIT","categories":["writing","friendship"],"data_vis":null},"html":"<p>It would be a lie to say that Havah and I immediately clicked. We met through a mutual friend at the end of sixth grade, but by that time I’d already formed a hasty opinion of her. I observed, judged, and decided from afar that I wasn’t interested in forming a relationship. She was too chirpy to the point of being obnoxious, and at an age where irrationalities ran high, I succumbed to my first impressions without further thought.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until seventh grade that I realized just how wrong I was. I’m not entirely sure the exact day we considered each other best friends, but the pages of my journal reflected a transition from frustration to excitement as my relationship with Havah blossomed. From using creative insults to memorize vocabulary words and discussing the prospects of life after death on our walks after school, I realized that her chirpiness was an optimistic outlook on life that I embrace today and her obnoxiousness was simply unfounded. Her encouragements helped me realize my love for journaling, while my support helped her discover her passion for biology and we watched her 76% in sixth grade science boost to 95% in seventh grade. From the laughs we shared in Chipotle and the hours we spent perfecting our peanut throws at Five Guys to being vegetarian and going to our first debate tournament together, Havah was right alongside me as we figured life out.</p>\n<p>Our interests in creative writing and similar approaches to life provided a strong basis for a collaboration on a novel in eighth grade, but not all conflicts were easily resolved. We set tight deadlines and high expectations, and argued over trivial aspects of the plot or what the cover should look like. But our bond strengthened as we learned to effectively communicate with each other, and in three months, finished the novel in 60k-70k and 26 chapters. Although “Tangled in Love” was filled with misplaced periods and run-on sentences, I’m proud we reached our goal and learned so much in the process. But all things come to an end, and middle school was no exception. We’d already discussed our matriculation to different high schools, but the tears fell nonetheless. Our yearbook messages were short and sweet, encompassing years of friendship in two inside jokes that will forever bring a smile to our faces.</p>\n<p>My relationship with Havah has changed since middle school, but the unconditional support we had for each other still remains. She was there for me when I twisted my knee in ninth grade and I was there for her as she learned about her identity. We spend Friday nights catching up on our lives, sometimes going back to Chipotle where it all started or calling each other when our schedules conflict. We spend breaks exploring the next chapter of our lives, planning our next novel or trekking across the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge to explore nature’s finest. And when we’re lost in the serenity of the trees around us, I’m reminded of the importance of looking beyond the superficial and appreciating all the cultures around me—because without an open mind, I would have missed out on one of best friendships of my life. Havah may not always be right by my side, but the lessons she has placed in my heart are more than enough. And perhaps, one day, I’ll leave a mark on the world as long-lasting as the influence Havah has left on my life.</p>"},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/a-bit-about-my-fit/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"August 9, 2020","title":"A Bit About My Fit","subtitle":"Combining my love for computer science with my love — though lesser now — for running, I learned a lot about my habits through Fitbit's Web API.","image":"fitbit.jpg","caption":"Two of my high school track buddies and I at the NYC Track Armory after winning the Indoor Borough Championships","categories":["projects","data","running"],"data_vis":["https://fitbit-data-analysis.herokuapp.com/","json"]},"html":"<script\n    src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/5.12.0/d3.min.js\"\n    integrity=\"sha256-+9Mf3cAVmxxudDsr1XwXUeRZFtvdWVYdq5/vcgiYyNU=\"\n    crossOrigin=\"anonymous\"\n></script>\n<p>For four years, running served as the syntax of my life. Whether it was struggling through eight mile reservoir runs in the heat or cheering teammates on during their races, practices provided structure for my weekdays and meets on my weekends. And not the mention the main goal: make a new personal record, or as the track community calls it: PR.</p>\n<p>Growing up, I'd always admired long distance runners for their stamina, grit, and the simple fact that I thought running looked cool. I was part of my middle school track team, but it wasn't very serious; we held practices once a week and attended one or two meets a year. So before I even started my first day at Bronx Science, I attended a pre-season practice that the womxn Cross Country and Track coaches hosted and fell in love with running. I was part of the Varsity team during my first year, but then suffered a knee injury that left me on crutches for two months. My health during my sophomore year was at its lowest and so was my running, but I got back into it during my junior year and ended my senior year as captain of all three seasons: Cross Country, Indoor Track, and Outdoor Track.</p>\n<p>I never broke some of my first year PR's and at some point, all of the pressure to meet expectations built up and track became more of a burden than a source of joy. Sometimes I wonder if I should've quit or done something else with my time, but I don't regret my experience. Running provided me with a great community and made me more outgoing, confident, and determined.</p>\n<p>As tribute to the four years I spent running around in circles, I decided to combine my love for computer science with my love — though lesser now — for running, and take a look at all of the data collected through Fitbit. I ordered my Fitbit around Thanksgiving, but since Thanksgiving gifts aren't that big of a thing, I consider it an early Christmas gift to myself. Looking back, I wish I got a Fitbit a few years earlier, so I can analyze and visualize my running throughout my high school years. But alas, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=hindsight+is+2020+memes&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwiEwZ6uvo3rAhUCjOAKHRTbDA0Q2-cCegQIABAA&oq=hindsight+is+2020+memes&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzICCAAyBggAEAgQHlCiJ1iiJ2DvN2gAcAB4AIABRIgBRJIBATGYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZ8ABAQ&sclient=img&ei=vJYvX4TzBYKYggeUtrNo&bih=818&biw=1595&hl=en#imgrc=9xZBXqRPBJwXmM\" target=\"_blank\">hindsight is 20/20</a></p>\n<p>The three main fields I decided to focus on are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exercise (distance traveled)</li>\n<li>Resting Heart Rate</li>\n<li>Sleep</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A few things to keep in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All data was queried using Fitbit's Web API for the past two or so years and normalized to [0,1] — because one, to more easily fit multiple lines in one chart, and two, safety: <em>anything you put online is forever</em></li>\n<li>All data was updated <span id=\"lastUpdated\">on August 10</span> and this blog post was written on August 10, 2020, so the contents of this page may not necessarily reflect on what the current data presents</li>\n<li>Some dates may be missing data because I forgot to wear my Fitbit, it ran out of battery, or any one of the three fields listed above are missing data</li>\n<li>Hover over the graphs and legends (sorry mobile folks — hover doesn't work on mobile)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The sleep data is a bit complicated, so I plotted <em>Distance</em> and <em>Resting Heart Rate</em> first. The frequency before June 2019 is pretty low compared to the rest of the graph because of more missing data points around that area. It's probably because I often noticed that my Fitbit was dead during the day, but my home was an hour and a half ride away from school, and I was often too tired and busy in the evenings to remember. The distance stats kind of surprise me; I expected my longest distance to be sometime in high school because I was running almost everyday then. I wonder what happened on November 2nd. There's a large dip mid-March due to quarantine. It's crazy how much data can show — and how easily.</p>\n<div class=\"lineGraph chart\" id=\"nonSleepGraph\" data-value=\"distance restingHeartRate\">Loading graph ...</div>\n<p>The way the sleep data is structured is that the date of the sleep is counted towards the date which you wake up. For example, if I fell asleep on 9PM on August 6th and woke up at 9AM on August 7th, then those 12 hours would be considered sleep for August 7th. However, if I fell asleep at 9PM on August 6th and woke up at 11PM on August 6th, that would be considered sleep for August 6th.</p>\n<p><em>Main Sleep</em> is as the name suggests: the main sleep of a day. For most people, including me, that's at night. It includes the <em>deep + light + rem</em> sleep of your sleep cycle. From what I can tell, my sleep schedule is pretty erratic throughout the days of the week, which is something I've noticed myself. Whenever I have a good night's sleep, I'd have trouble sleeping the following evening.</p>\n<p>I wonder if the local maximums are on the weekends, when I tried to catch up on the sleep I missed throughout the week. It's kind of interesting that my longest nap is May 13, 2019, a Monday when I had school. I probably woke up at 5:45AM when my alarm sounded, shut if off, and went back to sleep. It was too late to make it to school when I woke up at 9AM. The same thing happened on May 15.</p>\n<div class=\"lineGraph chart\" id=\"sleepGraph\" data-value=\"minutesSleep minutesNapped totalSleep\">Loading graph ...</div>\n<p><em>Main Sleep in Bed</em> is <em>Main Sleep</em> + wake (<em>deep + light + rem + wake</em>). I didn't know this before I got my Fitbit, but in a normal sleep cycle, it's pretty normal to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19956/\" target=\"_blank\">wake up briefly in the middle of the night</a> and most of the time, you don't notice because you're not awake for long.</p>\n<div class=\"lineGraph chart\" id=\"sleepInBedGraph\" data-value=\"minutesSleepInBed minutesNappedInBed totalSleepInBed\">Loading graph ...</div>\n<p>The shapes of the previous two graphs are nearly identical to each other. Since frequent awakenings in the middle of the night doesn't contribute to sleep, it makes more sense to look just at the <em>deep + light + rem</em> parts of the sleep cycle. I consolidated all of the sleep data to just one line — <em>Total Sleep</em> (<em>deep + light + rem</em>) — and plotted it along with <em>Distance</em> and <em>Resting Heart Rate</em>.</p>\n<p>It's interesting how the longest I ever slept was December 28, 2019, a week after I came back home for winter break. I wasn't used to sleeping at MIT, so the quality of my sleep wasn't the best. I also needed time adjusting back to my room at home, hence why it took a week after I came home. Even more interesting is that I ended up sleeping the same amount on December 28 in one sitting as I did on May 13! That nap on May 13 really boosted up the hours.</p>\n<div class=\"lineGraph chart\" id=\"mainGraph\" data-value=\"distance restingHeartRate totalSleep\">Loading graph ...</div>\n<p>I couldn't really see any trends due to the noise, so I plotted a 30-day moving average of the three lines. My sleep is pretty consistent month to month, even though it's not day to day. My resting heart rate seems to be increasing, probably because I'm no longer as active as I was in high school. My distance dramatically in March, but we could already tell from the first graph. What's interesting is the dip in distance from mid May - August 2019. Track was leveling off and during my internship that summer, I spent most of my time sitting at a desk.</p>\n<div class=\"lineGraph chart\" id=\"movingAverageGraph\" data-value=\"distance restingHeartRate totalSleep rolling-30\">Loading graph ...</div>\n<p>I wanted to compare the differences among days of the week, so I created a bar graph. I didn't expect my resting heart rate to change much over the course of the week, which the data supports. My sleep trends are pretty much expected; I could sleep in on Saturdays and Sundays, hence why I slept much more on the weekends. But I'm quite surprised that I cover more distance on Friday's, since track practices were rarely held then. But at MIT, my floor and I went out more frequently on Friday's than any other day of the week, so I guess it's somewhat expected. Sunday's are my rest days and the day to get a start on any homework / psets due the following week, so it makes sense why my distance coverage was so low compared to the rest of the week.</p>\n<div class=\"barGraph chart\" id=\"dayOfWeekBarGraph\" data-value=\"distance restingHeartRate totalSleep\">Loading graph ...</div>\n<p>I was curious about my trends throughout the different seasons, and out of all of the ones I've seen so far, this one surprises me the most. <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12783049/\" target=\"_blank\">Most people are more active in the spring and summer</a>, but my data suggests that I'm the opposite. My activity in the fall and winter combined is nearly half of the remaining two seasons added together; in fact, my fall activity is more than twice the distance I covered in the spring!</p>\n<p>I wasn't too concerned about when a specific season started or ended, so I just split them into four dates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spring: Mar 21 - Jun 20</li>\n<li>Summer: Jun 21 - Sep 20</li>\n<li>Fall: Sep 21 - Dec 20</li>\n<li>Winter: Dec 21 - Mar 20</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My spring data is kind of skewed because of COVID, but I do believe that the general trend is true. I'm more active in the fall and winter because of track and the fact that I'm around people all the\ntime, which makes it easier to make plans. School's still in season in the spring, but I used to suffer horrible allergies. It's interesting that my resting heart beat is also higher in the fall, when fall is when I'm the most active. I wonder how the data will change this fall, when I'm studying remotely.</p>\n<p>The amount of sleep I get across the seasons are pretty consistent, but I'm still a bit surprised that my hours in the summer are less than any other season; I actually expected the complete opposite since I generally have more time when school is out. I can only speculate, but my theory is that being more active combined with <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180815-why-sleep-should-be-every-students-priority\" target=\"_blank\">learning means my need for sleep is greater</a>, which explains why I'm tired all the time during school, even when the data shows that I get more sleep.</p>\n<div class=\"pieChart chart\" id=\"seasonsChart\" data-value=\"distance restingHeartRate totalSleep\">Loading graph ...</div>\n<p>Incorporating D3 with Gatsby and React — which my website is built on — was difficult and at times, I got so frustrated that I wondered why I even started this in the first place. Not only was my patience tested, but so was my problem solving skills. But I'm glad I pushed through. Here's some things I learned:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don't use arrow functions if you need access to <em>this</em> of the current element because you'll get <em>null</em>.</li>\n<li>I knew that Gatsby was static, but I didn't connect the dots — you can't access the <em>window</em> or <em>document</em> on render because they don't exist!</li>\n<li>The spread operator is amazing (and so are the other additions to ES6). It saves so much time and redundant code — and even does a deep copy (as long as you're not copying over nested objects). Too bad it's not supported by Node; I learned that the hard way.</li>\n<li>Speaking of deep copies, if a variable is unexpectedly changing when it shouldn't be, check to make sure you're not making a shallow copy.</li>\n<li>You can't trust how data is given to you. I assumed that since Fitbit collected data chronologically, the data would be retrieved in nondecreasing time as well. But before I realized, part of my charts looked like a kid's coloring book.</li>\n<li>Moving averages are so beautiful — and so is data!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And here's a fun fact to end off the post: I nearly covered the distance of a marathon in one day, which is more than the total distance I covered during three months of quarantine!</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
