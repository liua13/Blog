# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Hi! I'm Annie Liu (she/her), a second year undergrad at MIT pursuing a major in computer 
  science. I'm interested in full-stack development and data science, but that's not all:
  in addition to coding skills, I love to write stories. Although computer science and writing may 
  seem as different as anything gets, I believe that the creativity and storytelling involved in 
  writing is important in technology as well. Code should tell a story, so other engineers can 
  understand the flow. Data should tell a story, so you can see the general pattern. After all, 
  you communicate with computers the same way you communicate with the people around you. The 
  only difference is, instead of English, it's in Python.
